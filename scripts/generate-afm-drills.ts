 * generate-afm-drills.ts
 *
 * Drafts ACCA AFM practice drills and inserts them into `acca_drills` with
 * status='candidate', paper_code='AFM'. Ports scripts/generate-apm-drills.ts with the
 * AFM divergences from the pilot gap analysis:
 *
 *   • mode is READ from SYLLABUS_MAP (three-state: quantitative | mixed | discursive),
 *     never derived from a CALCULATION_LOS set (AFM has none).
 *   • calculation_required is resolved per INSTANCE: quantitative → true, discursive →
 *     false, mixed → scenario_supplies_figures (decided at spec time; no 'mixed' drill
 *     is generated in this pilot).
 *   • Pass-2 persona is EZRA (senior financial adviser to the board), not APM's Mia.
 *   • The APM examiner's nine content rules are REPLACED by the AFM failure catalogue
 *     (docs/TEACHING_PRINCIPLES_EZRA_AFM.md): fence-sitting, scenario-free discussion,
 *     hedging-specification, valuation-plumbing, undeveloped-assumption, and
 *     own-figure/abandoned-after-calc.
 *   • Quantitative drills follow the code-computes path (the D2e regression precedent),
 *     NOT the free-form model_answer path: the model supplies scenario + labelled raw
 *     inputs + evaluative prose ONLY; code (computeFcff) owns every figure, the answer
 *     schema, and the worked model answer. Doctrine: the model never decides the number
 *     (docs/AFM_NUMERIC_VERIFICATION_DESIGN.md §1).
 *
 * Every quantitative drill passes three HARD gates before insert (lib/acca/validate-schema.ts
 * + the OFR proof below): schema self-consistency, answer↔schema figure integrity, and a
 * seeded wrong-upstream carry-through proof through lib/acca/numeric-verifier.ts.
 *
 * PILOT SCOPE (2 drills): A3a (discursive) + B4c (quantitative, FCFF firm value). Only the
 * FCFF calculator is registered; other quantitative LOs throw "no calculator registered".
 * E2 forex hedging is pilot #2, gated on adding kind:'enum'/'integer' component types to
 * the numeric verifier (see AFM_NUMERIC_VERIFICATION_DESIGN.md §9).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run generate-afm-drills -- --los A3a,B4c [--dry-run]
 *   npm run generate-afm-drills -- --lo A3a [--dry-run]
 *
 * Reads .env.local for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

const AFM_CATALOGUE_RULES =
  'AFM CONTENT RULES — mandatory, grounded in the AFM examiner reports (D23–D25): ' +
  '(#2 NO FENCE-SITTING) Every calculative or analytic part MUST end in a clear recommendation drawn ' +
  "from the answer's own figures — state the decision and why, never just present two numbers and stop. " +
  '(#3 APPLY TO THIS SCENARIO) Every discussion point must name a SPECIFIC scenario fact (its currency, ' +
  "its base rate, a director's stated constraint or target) and what it implies HERE. A generic " +
  'advantage/disadvantage list, or restating the exhibit, scores limited credit. ' +
  '(#1 SCEPTICISM) For every director assertion and every stated assumption (no basis risk, no margin, a ' +
  'growth rate, a required return), state it, question it, and say what changes if it does not hold; do not ' +
  'accept assertions at face value; where the scenario states a board target or required return, the answer ' +
  'must compare results to it. ' +
  '(#4 HEDGING SPECIFICATION) For a hedging drill the answer is an executable instruction to the board — ' +
  'direction (buy/sell), contract month, whole number of contracts, correct unexpired-basis period — stated ' +
  'BEFORE the outcome figure. ' +
  '(#5 VALUATION PLUMBING) Match the flow to the rate: a firm flow (FCFF) is discounted at WACC, an equity ' +
  'flow (FCFE / dividends) at the cost of equity; interest stays OUT of FCFF (the return to debt is captured ' +
  'in the WACC, NOT deducted from the flow); strip debt to get equity value; add growth to a perpetuity ONLY ' +
  'where the scenario supports it; compute any growth rate from the data given. A wrong discount rate is a ' +
  'MISMATCH, never a stated directional effect — do NOT claim it "inflates" or "deflates" the value; whether ' +
  'it overstates or understates depends on the numbers. ' +
  '(PATTERN — CODE OWNS NUMBERS) In evaluative/advice prose, NEVER state a computed figure, an inequality ' +
  'between computed figures (e.g. that an offer is above/below the value), or a break-even value — these are ' +
  'inserted deterministically by code. Prose is qualitative reasoning only. ' +
  '(PATTERN — ONLY SCENARIO FACTS) Evaluative prose may reference ONLY facts present in the scenario/context — ' +
  'never invent events, cost savings, or risks not stated (e.g. do not assert "near-term cost savings" the ' +
  'scenario never gives). ' +
  '(PATTERN — NAMED RISKS ONLY FROM SCENARIO) Any risk premium, discount, or named risk factor cited in ' +
  'evaluative prose (an illiquidity premium, a key-person premium, a customer-concentration premium, a ' +
  'country/political risk) may name ONLY risks the scenario evidences — do not introduce a named risk the ' +
  'context does not state (e.g. do not invoke "key-person" risk where the scenario never mentions it). ' +
  '(#6 DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS) Each assumption → why it might not hold → its effect on the figure/decision; ' +
  'never a bare list of assumption headings. ' +
  '(#9 OWN-FIGURE / DO NOT ABANDON) A wrong upstream figure still earns the downstream method and the ' +
  'recommendation — the model answer should demonstrate carrying a figure forward, not restarting. ' +
  '(#8 FINISH WITH A CONCLUSION) A report-style answer ends with a brief concluding recommendation, and ' +
  'honours every clause of the requirement (including "suggest additional information", "identify omissions"). ' +
  'ASSERTION DISCIPLINE: state as fact ONLY what the scenario provides; any risk, threshold or cause not ' +
  'evidenced (covenant thresholds, delays, input-cost changes) is phrased conditionally ("the board should ' +
  'confirm whether…", "if X, then…"), never asserted. Scepticism challenges the data and names what to ' +
  'verify; it does not invent the answer. ' +

CODE-COMPUTES-STATS PROTOCOL — MANDATORY. Code owns EVERY figure and EVERY comparison. It
computes FCFF, firm value, equity value, the offer-vs-value verdict, and the break-even
sensitivities. Your job: supply the scenario, the raw input figures (including the offer), and
qualitative prose. DO NOT state anywhere: FCFF, firm value, equity value, any discount factor,
any inequality between computed figures (e.g. "the offer is below the value"), or any break-even.
Those are ALL inserted by code.

Requirements:
- Scenario set in ${spec.region_hint}, sector: ${spec.sector_hint}. Name an organisation the board is valuing (an acquisition target, a division being valued, or the company itself), and a vendor/asking price for its equity.
- question: begins with "Advise" — ask the candidate to value the firm and its equity using FCFF and ADVISE the board whether the stated offer price for the equity is justified.
- context_text: 2–3 sentences of scenario narrative + a clean labelled list of the raw inputs (money figures in millions of the LOCAL currency, rates in %): PBIT, tax rate, depreciation/non-cash, capex, the increase in working capital, the WACC, the long-term growth rate, the market value of debt, and the vendor's indicative equity offer/asking price. Use the local currency for ${spec.region_hint} (e.g. AUD, ZAR, BRL) consistently, and report its ISO code in the currency field. Add 1–2 challengeable textures (capex vs sustainable reinvestment; customer/contract concentration or cyclicality) so scepticism has something to bite. Give figures a candidate could compute from — do NOT pre-compute FCFF or value.
- Provide the SAME figures as the structured raw_inputs object (including offer_price). Rates (tax_rate, wacc, growth_rate) as DECIMAL FRACTIONS (0.25 for 25%). WACC must exceed the growth rate by at least 1 percentage point. Choose figures so FCFF and equity value are positive and debt is below firm value; set the offer realistically so "is it justified?" is a genuine judgement.
- interpretation_prose: qualitative advice ONLY (3–5 sentences), following the tool rules — NO numbers, NO inequalities between computed figures, NO break-evens, NO directional claim about a wrong discount rate, and ONLY facts present in context_text. Interest stays OUT of FCFF (financing is captured by the WACC and the debt strip). Cover which inputs are most fragile and why, and the due diligence the board should require.

Not a restatement of the model answer.

Anchor the reveal to the BOARDROOM BAR: the universal AFM failure is a calculation that never became advice. Where the drill is calculative, teach the own-figure move (carry a wrong figure forward — the downstream method and the recommendation still score).

Quality rules (mandatory):
- State the correct causal mechanism when reframing a misconception — WHY it produces the wrong conclusion, not just the right answer.
- Valuation plumbing: firm flow (FCFF) → WACC; equity flow (FCFE/dividends) → cost of equity; strip debt for equity value. Interest stays OUT of FCFF — the return to debt is captured in the WACC, not deducted from the flow (do NOT say interest must "stay in the flow"). A wrong discount rate is a MISMATCH, not a stated directional effect: do NOT claim it "inflates" or "deflates" value — whether it overstates or understates depends on the numbers.
- Use "may", "is likely to", "suggests" for causal chains; avoid "directly", "depends entirely on" where the scenario shows only plausibility.
- Reference ONLY facts present in the scenario/context — never invent events, savings, or risks; phrase un-evidenced risks conditionally.
